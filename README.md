# EuroScipy2023
I attended the 15th European Conference on Python in Science (EuroScipy2023). Here in this repository I summerized the teaching materials (github links) from the workshops I have attended.

## 1. Network Analysis Made Simple
Network analysis tutorial: https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple

Project Homepage / Git: github.com/networkx/networkx

Public link to supporting material: https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/
Workshop outline:

### Part 1: Introduction (30 min)

1. Networks of all kinds: biological, transportation, web.
2. Representation of networks, NetworkX data structures
3. Introduction to NetworkX API for modelling and graph operations.

### Part 2: Hubs and Paths (30 min)

1. Finding important nodes; applications
2. Pathfinding algorithms and their applications
3. Hands-on: implementing path-finding algorithms
4. Visualize degree and betweenness centrality distributions.

### Part 3: Speed up your code with NetworkX dispatching (30 min)

1. Quick introduction to GraphBLAS
2. Moving between GraphBLAS and NetworkX.
3. Speed up your NetworkX code by changing one line of code!


## 2. Introduction to Geospatial Machine Learning with SRAI

srai-tutorial: https://github.com/kraina-ai/srai-tutorial 

By the end of the tutorial, attendees will be able to:
1. Install and set up the SRAI library.
2. Use SRAI to download and process geospatial data.
3. Apply various regionalization and embedding techniques to geospatial data.
4. Utilize pre-trained embedding models for clustering and similarity search.
5. Build predictive models on top of SRAI embeddings
6. Pre-train available models from scratch.
7. Understand the potential applications and future enhancements of the SRAI library.

## 3. Introduction to NumPy


## 4. Predictive survival analysis with scikit-learn, scikit-survival and lifelines
Tutorial notebooks: https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/survival-analysis-demo

Here is a tentative agenda:

1. What is time-censored data and why it is a problem to train time-to-event regression models.
2. Single event survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier using scikit-survival.
3. Evaluation of the calibration of survival analysis estimators using the integrated brier score (IBS) metric.
4. Predictive survival analysis modeling with Cox Proportional Hazards, Survival Forests using scikit-survival, GradientBoostedIBS implemented from scratch with scikit-learn.
5. How to use a trained GradientBoostedIBS model to estimate the median survival time and the probability of survival at a fixed time horizon.
6. Inspecting the learned statistical association between input features and survival probabilities using partial dependence plot.

## 5. Introduction to scikit-learn
Workshop Outline:
1. Machine Learning 101 (10 min.)
2. What is scikit-learn? (5 min.)
3. Practical Part (+60 min.)
4. Predictive modeling pipeline
5. Evaluation of models
6. Hyperparameters tuning

## 6. Image processing with scikit-image
Tutorial: https://github.com/glemaitre/euroscipy-2023-scikit-image

Workshop Outline:
1. image histogram and contrast
2. image filtering: transformations of an image resulting in a new image of similar size (for example, thresholding, edge enhancement, etc.)
3. image segmentation: partitioning an image into several regions (objects)
4. image descriptors
