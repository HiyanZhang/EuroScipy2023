# EuroScipy2023
I attended the 15th European Conference on Python in Science (EuroScipy2023). Here in this repository I summerized the teaching materials (github links) from the workshop I have attended.

## 1. Network Analysis Made Simple
Network analysis tutorial: https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple

Project Homepage / Git: github.com/networkx/networkx

Workshop outline:
Part 1: Introduction (30 min)

Networks of all kinds: biological, transportation, web.
Representation of networks, NetworkX data structures
Introduction to NetworkX API for modelling and graph operations.
Part 2: Hubs and Paths (30 min)

Finding important nodes; applications
Pathfinding algorithms and their applications
Hands-on: implementing path-finding algorithms
Visualize degree and betweenness centrality distributions.
Part 3: Speed up your code with NetworkX dispatching (30 min)

Quick introduction to GraphBLAS
Moving between GraphBLAS and NetworkX.
Speed up your NetworkX code by changing one line of code!


## 2. Introduction to Geospatial Machine Learning with SRAI

srai-tutorial: https://github.com/kraina-ai/srai-tutorial 
By the end of the tutorial, attendees will be able to:
1. Install and set up the SRAI library.
2. Use SRAI to download and process geospatial data.
3. Apply various regionalization and embedding techniques to geospatial data.
4. Utilize pre-trained embedding models for clustering and similarity search.
5. Build predictive models on top of SRAI embeddings
6. Pre-train available models from scratch.
7. Understand the potential applications and future enhancements of the SRAI library.

## 3. Introduction to NumPy


## 4. Predictive survival analysis with scikit-learn, scikit-survival and lifelines
Tutorial notebooks: https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/survival-analysis-demo
Here is a tentative agenda:

What is time-censored data and why it is a problem to train time-to-event regression models.
Single event survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier using scikit-survival.
Evaluation of the calibration of survival analysis estimators using the integrated brier score (IBS) metric.
Predictive survival analysis modeling with Cox Proportional Hazards, Survival Forests using scikit-survival, GradientBoostedIBS implemented from scratch with scikit-learn.
How to use a trained GradientBoostedIBS model to estimate the median survival time and the probability of survival at a fixed time horizon.
Inspecting the learned statistical association between input features and survival probabilities using partial dependence plot.

## 5. Introduction to scikit-learn
Workshop Outline:
Machine Learning 101 (10 min.)
What is scikit-learn? (5 min.)
Practical Part (+60 min.)
Predictive modeling pipeline
Evaluation of models
Hyperparameters tuning

## 6. Image processing with scikit-image
Tutorial: https://github.com/glemaitre/euroscipy-2023-scikit-image

Workshop Outline:
image histogram and contrast

image filtering: transformations of an image resulting in a new image of similar size (for example, thresholding, edge enhancement, etc.)

image segmentation: partitioning an image into several regions (objects)

image descriptors
